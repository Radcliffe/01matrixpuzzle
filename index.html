<h1>0-1 Matrix Puzzle</h1>

<p><strong>Instructions:</strong>
    Transform the matrix to the identity matrix in <span id="goal">9</span> steps.
    The identity matrix has ones along the main diagonal (top left to bottom right)
    and zeros elsewhere. A step consists of adding one row to another, then replacing
    the twos with zeros (i.e. adding mod 2).
    To perform this operation, click on two of the buttons
    <span id="row-names">(R1, R2, R3, R4)</span> to the left of the matrix.</p>

<p>It is believed (but not proved) that 3n &minus; 3 steps are required in general.
    Can you prove this? Let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Technical discussion:</strong>
    This app explores the group of nonsingular n-by-n matrices over the field of two elements.
    This group is generated by transvections, i.e. adding one row to another row mod 2.</p>

<p>A row swap can be decomposed into three transvections, by the
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XOR_swap_algorithm">XOR trick</a>.
    Since any permutation of n elements can be expressed as the product of at most n &minus; 1 transpositions,
    it follows that any permutation matrix can be expressed as the product of at most 3n &minus; 3 transvections.</p>

<p>It is <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01467">conjectured</a> that the permutation matrix corresponding to an
    n-cycle requires no fewer than 3n &minus; 3 transvections. This has been verified up to n = 8.</p>
